# OwnStak Security

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability/issue in this package or any other OwnStak component, please let us know right away by [opening a private security advisory](../../security/advisories/new) on GitHub.

Please include:

* a clear description of the problem
* exact steps to reproduce the issue
* affected versions of the project
* workarounds or mitigations if known

We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to fix the problem quickly. You should expect an initial response within **3 business days**.

⚠️ **Important:** Please DO NOT share security issues in public forums/places (GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, Discord, etc...) before we have confirmed and addressed the report. We know you're proud of your discovery and want to show off to your friends - but resist the urge! Keep it secret, keep it safe.

## Embargo Policy

While we are working on a fix, details of the issue must remain private. This ensures users are protected until a patch is available. 
No sneaky leaks to your friends, your neighbor, or even your cat. If information is shared by mistake, please let us know right away so we can take the proper steps. 
We'll let you know as soon as it's safe to share more details.
